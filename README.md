# WaveyDave
C++ code for the Arduino microcontroller controlling the wave speed of the biomimetic robot rival

The .ino file can be opened with the Arduino IDE and uploaded to an Arduino UNO (or similar Arduino system). If it's set up as pictured in the circuit diagram it <i>should</i>
work as intended and be controllable via the app.

The app is a .aab bundle and is only compatible with Android phones. I apologise for the ugly UI, I didn't have much time or incentive to refine it while in the field.
Happy waving!
